Download Python:

Visit the official Python website at python.org.
Hover over the "Downloads" menu, and click on "Python X.X" (replace X.X with the latest version available).
Scroll down to the "Files" section, and choose the installer that matches your Windows architecture (either 32-bit or 64-bit). Most modern systems are 64-bit.
Run the Installer:

Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on it to run the installer.
Configure Python Installation:

In the Python Installer, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH" during installation. This makes it easier to run Python from the command line.
Customize Installation (Optional):

You can customize the installation by clicking on the "Customize installation" button. Here, you can choose which optional features to install, and you can also customize the installation location.
Install Python:

Click on the "Install Now" button to start the installation. The installer will copy the necessary files to your system.
Wait for Installation:

The installer will display a progress bar as it installs Python. Wait for the installation to complete.
Complete the Setup:

Once the installation is finished, you will see a screen that says "Setup was successful." You can now close the installer.
Verify Installation:

Open the command prompt (you can do this by pressing Win + R, typing cmd, and pressing Enter).
Type python --version or python -V and press Enter. This should display the installed Python version.
Bash : C:\>python --version
for example: Python 3.11.7
You can also type python and press Enter to enter the Python interactive shell. Type exit() to exit the shell.

Run the System in main.py after that, and you should see the run button on the Visual Studio's right side.

However, there will be a problem with it since it will indicate that you must install Python in Visual Studio Code. If you already have Python installed, you can proceed without any issues.

then it's time for you to test the system locally.
